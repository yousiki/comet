# chat2: dumb-relay session sync + thin docs

Status: PLANNED · Author: 2026-08-09 investigation (whale-doc dissection + t3code comparison)
Prior art: `docs/registry-sync.md` (the same argument, applied to the profile registry).

## Why

Two compounding problems, one measured root cause:

1. **Session docs got fat.** The tool-output/diff caps (c951c3e, 2026-08-07) bound each
   *part*, not the *session*. Dissection of chat `1b65e93d` ("ACP Model Traits
   Integration Polish"): 1,079,986-byte snapshot, 10 messages, 426 tool parts —
   **917 KB (85%) is capped tool output**, history overhead 1.00× (pure payload, not
   oplog bloat). Every agentic session now reaches the ~1 MB wasm-wedge zone in a day.
2. **The SessionRoom DO wedges at that size.** Every incident class of Aug 4–5 (wasm
   heap poison, use-after-free doc wrappers, replay CPU-limit death, silent shallow
   exports, import penalty box) exists because the DO materializes the doc through
   loro-wasm. At 1 MB docs these fire routinely: the fresh-device symptom is
   join-OK → 3 silent rejoins → `REJECTED 3` (penalty box) → no backfill, forever.

Priority (product decision): **flawless sync on ~1.2 Mbps links beats tool-output
transparency.** Small docs first, unwedgeable serving second; neither substitutes for
the other (stripping shrinks bytes, the relay makes serving them instant and reliable).

## Non-goals

- Replacing Loro. Clients keep real Loro docs: same schema, same offline
  commit-then-converge, same command-ledger-as-outbox. Only the DO stops parsing bytes.
- Windowed/partial doc loads. Out of scope; the host-published tail sidecar covers
  first-paint latency.
- Preserving full tool outputs inside the synced doc. They move to a lazy sidecar.

## Workstream A — thin docs (ship first, independently)

Stops new whales being born. No protocol changes; additive on the existing s2 rooms.

**A1. Fold strips outputs/diffs to summaries.** In `crates/doc/src/parts.rs`:
- `output`: keep first non-empty line, ≤160 chars (t3code ships 84 and users cope).
  Add additive fields `outputRef: Option<String>` (sidecar key) and
  `outputBytes: Option<u64>` so the UI can render "Show full output (12 KB)".
- `diff`: replace inline `ToolDiff` text with per-file stats `{path, additions,
  deletions}` (t3's shape) + `diffRef`. Kill `TOOL_DIFF_DOC_CAP` usage — the 32 KB/edit
  inline diff is a bigger bomb than outputs, currently unexercised only because the
  claude harness emits none.
- Old readers: both fields are already serde-additive; old app versions render the
  summary as if it were the output. Acceptable.

**A2. Output sidecar.** *[PARKED 2026-08-10 (v0.1.30): product call — no R2
uploads for now. The fold keeps small outputs inline (≤160 chars,
fence-stripped) and summarizes big ones; full text survives only in the
host's run journal. The machinery below (blob routes, `sidecar_payload`,
`apply_sidecar_refs`, `upload_tool_sidecar`, UI upgrade path) is built,
tested, and dormant — reintroduction is re-adding one call site in
`sessions.rs`. M1's rebuild still returns sidecar payloads; the C3 cutover
must decide their fate (upload or drop) before flipping `roomGen`.]* Full (still 4 KiB-capped at the harness boundary) outputs and
diffs go to R2 through a Worker route (no DO involvement — the `BLOBS` bucket already
exists): `PUT/GET /blob/{chatId}/{partId}` , owner-auth via the existing Worker JWT
check. Host uploads are debounced/batched per commit tick, fire-and-forget (a lost
upload degrades to "full output unavailable", never blocks the doc). UI fetches on
expand; offline shows the summary + a greyed affordance.

**A3. UI.** Tool-part expansion fetches `outputRef` lazily; render summary inline.

Estimate: 2–3 days. Ships in the next release; immediately cuts new-session growth ~7×.

## Workstream B — chat2 edge room (dumb authenticated log relay)

New DO class `ChatRoom`, room name `chat2/{chatId}`, modeled line-for-line on
`RegistryRoom` (registry-room.ts, 425 LOC), not on SessionRoom. **No loro-wasm import
anywhere in the class.** With this, `edge/src/session-doc/` (the TS schema mirror) and
the wasm bundling alias eventually die with s2.

**Storage** (DO SQLite):
- `rows(seq INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, device TEXT, batch_id TEXT UNIQUE, bytes BLOB)` —
  opaque Loro update blobs. Per-row cap 1 MB (post-strip updates are KB-scale;
  oversized rows are rejected at the header, matching today's discipline).
- checkpoint blob via `blobs.ts` chunking + `meta`: `owner`, `seqFloor`,
  `checkpointFrontier BLOB` (opaque, client-written), `checkpointSize`,
  `checkpointSeq`, `tailDirty`.
- Sidecars: `tail` and `diff` blobs become **host-published** (`PUT /tail`,
  `PUT /diff`), served verbatim. The DO never materializes anything.

**Protocol** (binary WS frames: 1-byte type + JSON header + raw payload; no
loro-protocol, no base64 — 33% base64 overhead matters at 1.2 Mbps):
- `hello{cursor, device}` → `state{seqFloor, headSeq, checkpointSeq,
  checkpointFrontier, checkpointSize}` — metadata only, then:
- **Client-side precision** (replaces the server VV diff): client compares
  `checkpointFrontier` against its local doc frontiers.
  Included → skip the checkpoint, request `rows{after: max(cursor, checkpointSeq)}`.
  Not included → `GET /checkpoint` (HTTP, **Range-resumable** — a stored blob can
  resume at byte N; today's export-per-join cannot), then rows after `checkpointSeq`.
- `rows{after, excludeDevice}` → server streams rows `seq > after AND device !=
  excludeDevice` — you never re-download your own writes (matters exactly on the
  reconnect-after-offline-work path).
- `push{batchId, bytes}` → append + relay + `ack{batchId, seq}`. `batch_id UNIQUE`
  dedupes reconnect re-pushes server-side (client keeps a pending-unacked queue,
  registry-style; Loro re-import is a no-op so duplicates are safe end-to-end).
- `POST /checkpoint {seqCovered, frontier}` + chunked blob: owner-only, guarded by
  `seqCovered >= seqFloor` (floor-monotonic — the dumb replacement for the VV-monotonic
  R2 guard). Rows `seq <= seqCovered` deleted after commit.
- Presence: relay opaque ephemeral frames to live sockets with a 30 s TTL sweep —
  broadcast only, no EphemeralStore on the server.
- Validation kept (all wasm-free): auth/owner, frame shape, row size cap, per-device
  rate/byte quotas. Semantic garbage is contained per-user (owner-only rooms), skipped
  by client imports (malformed-entry philosophy), and erased by the next checkpoint.
- Ops: `GET /stats` (headSeq, seqFloor, rowBytes, checkpoint age), nightly
  seq-monotonic R2 backup (registry pattern), tombstone-free — rows are the log.

Estimate: 3–4 days including tests (registry-room test suite is the template).

## Workstream C — Rust client + host duties

**C1. `crates/sync/src/chat_client.rs`** modeled on `registry.rs` (764 LOC): cursor
tracking, pending-push queue with batch ids, hello/backfill/live loop, frontier
comparison for checkpoint skip, reconnect/backoff/wake plumbing reused from the
existing supervisor machinery. The layered liveness model (ping lease, join deadline,
probe clock) carries over — those lessons are transport-level, not CRDT-level.

**C2. Store migration** (`crates/sync/src/store.rs` MIGRATIONS — append entry #N):
`ALTER TABLE snapshots ADD COLUMN cursor INTEGER; ADD COLUMN epoch INTEGER` — cursor
persisted **in the same transaction** as the snapshot bytes, so content and cursor
cannot diverge (this kills the restored-backup/copied-device redownload cases at the
root).

**C3. Host duties** (`doc_host.rs`):
- Checkpoint policy: post a full checkpoint when server `rowBytes > 512 KB` or
  `rows > 200` (from `/stats` piggybacked on hello) — thresholds cheap to tune later.
  History trim: shallow checkpoint only at a frontier older than RETAIN_DAYS, same
  aged-frontier discipline as today (the ws4 live-frontier lesson: an offline device's
  concurrent ops must never land behind a shallow root).
- Tail sidecar: publish last-64 JSON on the debounced commit tick (dirty-flag, like
  the DO's current lazy recompute). Diff sidecar publish moves from `diff_sync.rs`'s
  DO PUT to the chat2 PUT unchanged.
- Non-host owner devices may checkpoint as fallback if floor lag exceeds a high-water
  mark (any device holds the full doc; ~20 lines, ships later if ever needed — hosts
  must be online to execute commands anyway, so lag is bounded in practice).

Estimate: 4–5 days.

**C4. iOS** (`apps/ios/Zeron/Sync/`): `ChatRoomClient.swift` cloned from
`RegistryClient.swift`; delete `LoroProtocol.swift` once s2 dies. Shared framing test
vectors across Rust/TS/Swift (registry precedent). Estimate: 3–4 days, can trail
desktop by a release.

## Migration + whale healing

The healing insight: **wedged s2 rooms are never repaired — they are bypassed.** The
host's local doc is the source of truth; the wedged DO simply stops receiving traffic
and ages out. This turns the incident-recovery problem into the migration problem.

**M1. Epoch rebuild (the healing step).** On first chat2 seed, the host does not
upload its fat doc — it **rebuilds a thin one**: fold every entry, strip outputs/diffs
to A1 summaries, upload the full texts it already holds to the A2 sidecar (existing
whale outputs stay viewable!), write fresh Loro doc with `meta.epoch = 2`. The
1 MB whale becomes ~160 KB with zero information loss. Commands: copy only unresolved
ledger entries (dedupe via `evaluate_command` + the mark-before-execute
`processed_commands` table protects against re-execution).

**M2. Cutover signal.** The registry chat row gains a `roomGen` field (per-field HLC
LWW like everything else): absent/1 = s2, 2 = chat2. The host flips it in the same
breath as seeding. Devices dial the room the registry names. No dual-write: at current
fleet scale (auto-updated within hours) a stale client seeing a frozen s2 doc until it
updates is acceptable; the field makes the cutover per-chat and instantly revertible.

**M3. Rebuild-vs-lineage on other devices.** A device opening a `roomGen: 2` chat whose
local doc has `epoch < 2` (or no doc): discard local doc **after** re-queueing any of
its own unresolved commands as fresh entries in the new doc, then adopt the chat2
checkpoint. Keep the old snapshot row (suffixed doc id, registry-migration precedent)
for rollback. Idempotent: epoch check makes re-entry a no-op.

**M4. Ordering.**
1. Release N: Workstream A (strip + sidecar). New sessions stop growing; nothing else
   changes. Bake ~2–3 days on the fleet.
2. Release N+1: B + C behind `roomGen`. Hosts migrate chats lazily — on next open or
   next command — not in a thundering herd. Wedged whales (the chats users actually
   notice) migrate the moment the user touches them: open → host rebuilds → seeds
   chat2 → flips registry → every device loads a 160 KB doc from a table-read DO.
3. s2 rooms: orphaned like ws3 before them. Nightly R2 backups already exist for
   forensics; delete the route after a deprecation window.
4. iOS in the following release; until then iOS reads `roomGen: 2` chats via the tail
   sidecar (read-only fallback it already has for thin clients) — or gate the flip on
   fleet capability if that's not acceptable.

**M5. Edge cases.**
- Host retired/dead, other devices hold the doc: first owner device to open the chat
  performs the seed (claim-on-first-seed; floor-monotonic guard makes a race benign —
  worst case two identical rebuilds, second checkpoint wins).
- No device holds the doc (only R2 backup of the wedged s2 room): operator path —
  extend `examples/doc_surgery.rs` to rebuild a thin doc from a backup blob and seed
  chat2 manually. Expected count: single digits.
- Mid-migration crash: seeding is (rebuild locally → POST checkpoint → flip registry).
  Each step idempotent; a crash before the flip leaves the chat on s2, retried next open.

**M6. Immediate relief (optional, pre-chat2).** For currently-wedged chats where the
user can't wait a release cycle: `POST /reset-log` on the s2 room + host re-push works
today but re-uploads the fat doc and will re-wedge. Only worth doing per-chat on
explicit request; the real healing is M1.

## Observability / acceptance

- `zeron sync` gains per-chat `cursor / headSeq / floorLag / pendingPushes`.
- Alert-shaped stat: any room with `headSeq - checkpointSeq` bytes > 2 MB or
  checkpoint age > 7 days (the passive failure mode this design trades into — make it
  visible from day one; silent truncation of the old wedge class must not become
  silent growth of a new one).
- e2e: extend `scripts/e2e-smoke.sh` — two engines, chat2 room, kill/rejoin mid-push,
  cursor resume, checkpoint-skip via frontier match, 1 MB fixture load under
  `tc`-throttled 1.2 Mbps (load must complete and be Range-resumable).
- Exit criterion mirroring the registry migration: `churn_stays_bounded` equivalent —
  N days of streaming on a chat2 room, rows never exceed the checkpoint threshold ×2.

## Sequencing summary

| Step | What | Size |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A: strip outputs/diffs + sidecar | 2–3 d |
| 2 | B: ChatRoom DO + tests | 3–4 d |
| 3 | C: Rust client, store migration, host duties | 4–5 d |
| 4 | M: epoch rebuild, roomGen cutover, e2e | 2–3 d |
| 5 | iOS client | 3–4 d (trails) |

Roughly three weeks end-to-end with bake time, front-loaded so the bleeding (new
whales) stops in the first release.
